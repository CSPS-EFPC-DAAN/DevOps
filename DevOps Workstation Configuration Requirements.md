# DevOps Workstation Configuration Requirements

Your mission should you choose to accept it, will be to build an awesome development workstation! You will use this workstation to complete your work as part of the DevOps cohort.

Your fellow students, facilitators and Digital Academy folks are here to help you via the #devops Slack channel (https://csps-efpc-daan.slack.com/messages/CG1DFTBSP)

## Hardware
We can provide you with the an HP EliteBook 830 G5 laptop, which will be yours for the duration of the course. They have the  the following specs:
- Intel i5-8350U @ 1.7GHz
- 16GB memory
- 250GB SSD drive
- 13" screen

Alternatively you can use your own laptop as long as you have full admin rights and it's an off network device (not connected to any Government of Canada network). This can be something your department provided you or your own personal device.

Contact Cory Dignard to let us know what you plan on doing. Cory.Dignard@canada.ca or on csps-efpc-daan.slack.com.

## Operating System
The HP laptops we provide come pre-installed with Windows 10 Pro. You can choose to use this, or re-image with Linux, such as Ubuntu (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). If you provide your own device it can be Linux, Windows or macOS.
